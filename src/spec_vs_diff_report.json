  "summary": "Backend was extended to include optional social fields and crypto address on the Registrant type and a data migration module was added. Frontend registration and directory pages appear to add/consume these fields, but there is evidence that OISY wallet-related code/config may still exist (e.g., oisyWallet utility and an OisyWalletNavItem component), and multiple unrelated deployment/diagnostics/theme changes were introduced that were not requested.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-34",
      "requirement": "Remove the in-app wallet entry point from the application navigation (desktop header nav and mobile menu) so users no longer see any Wallet/OISY Wallet item, and ensure there is no remaining user-facing wallet-related UI text or tooltip in the app navigation.",
      "reason": "The diff indicates a dedicated wallet navigation item component still exists, which suggests the wallet entry point may not have been fully removed from navigation. The AppLayout snippet is truncated, so it is not possible to confirm the wallet item is absent from both desktop and mobile navigation.",

      "id": "REQ-35",
      "requirement": "Remove unused OISY wallet configuration usage from the frontend so the app does not depend on or reference the OISY wallet URL environment variable (VITE_OISY_WALLET_URL) for any UI behavior.",
      "reason": "A wallet-specific utility file remains present in the diff, which strongly suggests the frontend may still contain runtime code paths related to opening/using an OISY wallet URL configuration.",
