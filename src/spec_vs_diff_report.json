  "summary": "Diff adds/enhances frontend deployment diagnostics (runtime inference of network/canister ID, mismatch detection UI) and a DEPLOYMENT.md guide, but does not provide evidence of an actual IC redeploy, recorded canister IDs, or verified reachable mainnet URL outcomes requested in REQ-31/32/33.",

      "id": "REQ-31",
      "requirement": "Re-run `dfx deploy --network ic` and capture the deployed frontend and backend canister IDs from the deployment output.",
