  "summary": "The diff adds a new /world route and page with a React Three Fiber 3D planet scene, plus a React Query hook that polls a registrant-count API and renders a numeric total. However, key parts of REQ-23 backend support are not evidenced in the backend diff, and the “new inhabitants appear” behavior (REQ-24) appears incorrectly implemented; performance safeguards for large counts are also not evidenced. Navigation includes a desktop header link to the new page; mobile inclusion cannot be confirmed from the truncated diff.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-23",
      "requirement": "Backend query API to return total number of registrants with the same authentication policy as listAllRegistrants/searchRegistrants.",
      "reason": "Frontend calls actor.getTotalNumberOfRegistrants(), but the backend diff snippet does not show any new query method being added/implemented, nor its auth checks. With truncated backend diff, there is insufficient evidence that the required backend API exists.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-24",
      "requirement": "When the registrant total increases between polls, add only the difference as new inhabitants and animate them appearing (without re-randomizing existing inhabitants).",
      "reason": "WorldPage updates previousCount to the current count when count increases, which makes previousCount equal to count; PlanetWorldScene then marks new inhabitants using `isNew: i >= previousCount`, resulting in no inhabitants being treated as new on the updated render (and thus no entry animation on increases).",

    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-24",
      "requirement": "Provide basic performance safeguards so the visualization remains usable for several hundred inhabitants (e.g., instancing/points/caps).",
      "reason": "PlanetWorldScene renders one Mesh (sphereGeometry) per inhabitant via a map over `count` with no evident caps, instancing, or point rendering; this may not meet the performance safeguard requirement and no mitigation is shown in the diff.",
